# St. Martha Student Blog Platform

##This is a project for Code Louisville's PHP Track 2015

As a Grade Schooler in CA over 30 years ago, I was exposed to computer programming in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade.  I remember creating "Choose your own Adventure" type games as well as a controllable Superman type figure using BASIC.

I strongly believe that because I was coding at such a young age I am able in my 40's to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.  If our children aren't exposed at a young age to computer programming in school I believe they'll be behind the curve later in life (see [Plasticity](http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Plasticity) for the Psychology behind it).

This is very similar to learning a foreign language.  If you're exposed to any form of foreign language as a child (or even musical instrument instruction), you'll have a much clearer path to learning as an adult.

Conversely, if you have no exposure as a child, it's extremely difficult to learn, ask any adult who's tried to learn guitar without having prior musical tutelage.

Our computer science teacher at our children's school, James Key, has graciously agreed to allow me to help create a Coding Club at St. Martha Elementary this January, coinciding with the end of ["Hour of Code"](https://hourofcode.com/us).

I decided to devote this PHP project for [Code Louisville](http://www.codelouisville.org/) to helping the students further delve into their computer interest by using PHP to create a mini-blogging platform for them to use to reflect on anything they want, the point being simply to ensure they're spending time working on a computer, instead of an XBox, during free time in the Winter.

There is now a live version of this site [here](https://shamrocks.xyz/).  There will be subtle styling differences as I begin maintaining and updating the live site for actual student use, but will try to keep this repo current (repo db paswords and keys are not valid in live site for security reasons).
